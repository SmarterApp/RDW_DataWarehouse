			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<p>This report is intended to provide top-level insight into the results of a single student’s summative
			<br>assessment.   There is more detailed information available on the various parts that come together 
			<br>to make this summary possible.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Uses:</h4>
			<p> Use this report to understand where this student is, in terms of their assessed grade, on the path
			<br> towards career and college content-readiness.  If the descriptions provided within do not match
			<br> your understanding of where the student should be, use the more detailed information to ascertain
			<br> where the discrepancy may be.   Use this report to support the Teacher-Student-Parent partnership,
			<br> whether it provides context for a parent-teacher conference or helps to identify areas to concentrate
			<br> on in the coming year(s).
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Qualifications:</h4>
			<p>There may be ways in which the contents of this report might be misconstrued.  The following list
			<br></p>contains examples of conclusions that are not supported by this report:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					No score is prescriptive of the abilities of the student, it is simply what they were able to 
					<br>demonstrate during a given assessment administration.  There are always resources available 
					<br>to support a student’s progress.
				</li>
				<li>
					This is a criterion-reference test, which provides a characterization of the student’s mastery 
					<br>of a domain of subject matter.  This result in no way indicates whether the test-taker did “better” 
					<br>or “worse” than other people who took the test. Further, the Computer-Adaptive nature of the test
					<br>makes it very unlikely that two students will ever take exactly the same test.
