    "reportInfo": "<h4>Purpose:</h4><p>This report presents individual student assessment scores and provides guidance on how to interpret the results.</p><br/><h4>Uses:</h4><ul><li>Educators, parents or students may use this report to understand student achievement, progress toward mastery of the Common Core State Standards and attainment of the academic knowledge and skills required to be college content- and career-ready.</li></ul><br/><h4>Understanding your score:</h4><p>The Smarter Balanced assessment is different than other tests with which you may be familiar.</p><ul><li>First, the Smarter Balanced assessments are Computer Adaptive Tests and take advantage of technology to customize each test to the individual student. This means that when a student answers a question correctly, the next question they see will be slightly more difficult. Likewise, if an answer is incorrect, the next question will be somewhat less difficult. This procedure allows for more efficient and precise measurement of students' knowledge and skills.</li><li>Second, the assessment is a criterion-referenced test, meaning that it reports individual students’ understanding of a particular set of academic knowledge and skills. As a result, scores are not meant to compare students to each other, but rather to determine how well each student understands the content assessed. </li></ul><br/><h4>Important Information about Interim Assessments:</h4><ol><li>Questions on interim tests that require human scoring may be scored locally by teachers. This local scoring is not subject to the rigorous controls used in summative assessment and local results may show some variations.</li><li>Interim assessment questions are not secure. Exposure to, and familiarity, with test questions may affect student performance and the accuracy of interim results.</li></ol><br/>",
