                        "answer": "There are three types of reports:<ul><li>Aggregate, or rolled up, reports present a view of student performance on the most recent summative assessment for the state, district, school or grade. These reports show comparisons between districts in a state, schools in a district, or grades in a school. These reports are available to all authorized educators to see their state, district and school information.</li><li>The List of Students report displays overall scores and claim-level information for a group of students in a school. This report is only available to educators with access to personally identifiable information for the group of students in the report.  This report provides information for summative and interim assessments.</li><li>The Individual Student Report presents overall scores and claim-level information for an individual student. Educators with access to personally identifiable information for a student are able to view this report and share it with parents and students via print out or email.  This report provides information for summative and interim assessments.</li></ul>"},

                        "question": "How does Smarter Balanced protect students’ privacy?",
                        "answer": "Smarter Balanced has taken a number of steps to ensure that all student data is stored securely and protected.<ul><li>Data Separation – all data sent from a state to the Smarter Balanced Data Warehouse will be stored in its own set of data stores to ensure that users from one state are not permitted to view another state’s data.</li><li>Single Sign On (SSO) – Users will log into the reporting system through the Smarter Balanced SSO, which will control user access centrally and provide users with access as directed by their states .</li><li>User access control - States control the level of access that they grant their users and the Data Warehouse enforces those rules. This allows each state to set its own policies around the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and to protect against unauthorized access to student data.<br><br>States will define which districts and schools a user is entitled to see as well as whether they can see any student information. If they are entitled to see student information, the user access policies dictate which student data they are allowed to view.<br><br>States control data for students in their state, not the Consortium, and states are the only entity that can grant access to data.  The Consortium is simply the custodian of stored data.</li><li>Encryption – All data stored in the Data Warehouse is encrypted to protect it against external threats.</li></ul>"},

                        "answer": "The reporting system presents aggregate, or rolled up, reports that display a view of student performance on the most recent summative assessment for the state, district, or school. The reports display multi-colored bars that represent the different achievement levels. The percentages of students and total number of students within each state, district or school performing at each level appear as numbers in the bars."},

                        "answer": "Aggregate reports only include Summative assessment data.  At the grade-level and below, reports that display individual student data also have an Assessment Selector. This feature provides the ability to select between Summative and Interim assessment results for the chosen report."},

                        "answer": "The time between when a given student completes an assessment and when that student’s assessment record is included in reports will depend on a number of factors, chiefly the time it takes to score the report.<br><br>The Data Warehouse accepts individual scored records from the Test Administration System, and processes uploaded records once a day.
